# AREA Project Repository

Welcome to the AREA project repository, a comprehensive business application designed to work similarly to IFTTT and/or Zapier. This repository contains both the frontend and backend projects, offering a complete solution for creating and managing automation workflows.

## About the Project

The project consists of two main components:

### Backend

The backend serves as the core of the AREA platform and provides the necessary APIs and server infrastructure to manage and execute automation tasks. It is built using modern technologies and tools, including TypeScript, Express, and ESLint.

For detailed information on the backend, installation instructions, and available scripts, please refer to the [Backend README](./backend/README.md).

### Frontend

The frontend complements the backend by providing a user interface for creating and managing automation tasks. It is typically built using popular web technologies such as React, React Router, Axios, and Tailwind CSS.

For detailed information on the frontend, installation instructions, and available scripts, please refer to the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md).
